A **huge** thanks to derns#5715 (https://github.com/upshaw) for completely rewriting the source code  
which was published as version 1.2. He also released the language-josh package on the atom text editor!  
This allows you to get your syntax highlighted when writing code in JoshScript.

# What's new?
JoshScript 1.3 has been released and contains a new code which cubes the value.

**Release history - new in older versions:**  
JoshScript 1.2.2 release contained a few bug fixes and updated functions.  
JoshScript 1.2 included a new ability to loop! Examples and usage will be coming soon.

# Usage codes
`JOSH` increases the value by 1

`josh` decreases the value by 1

`Josh` multiplies the value by 2

`josH` divides the value by 2, rounding down to the nearest integer

`JOsh` outputs the ascii symbol with Unicode number equal to current value

`JoSH` takes integers as input and sets the value to that

`JOsH` takes characters as input and sets the value to ascii number of char

`jOsh` resets the value to 0

`JOSh` squares the value

`jOSh` cubes the value

`JosH` outputs the current value

`joSH` moves one to the right on the tape reel of values

`joSh` moves one to the left on the tape reel of values

`JoSh` starts loop if the value is not 0, else jump to matching end loop tag

`jOsH` ends a loop

`(` starts notation space

`)` ends notation space

# Instructions
1. If _execute_script.bat\*_ has the text "D:\Documents\Dev\JoshScript\source\JoshScript.py",  
change it to "JoshScript.py" (uses the relative file path of your downloaded folder).

2. If you would like to use an _execute_script.bat\*_ for (GNU/)Linux or one that  
has "mac"/"linux" in its name and are going to run it from the command line,  
you need to add executable rights (change mode bits) - using this command  
in a _terminal_ (command line) app, opened in the folder that has the file:  
```
chmod +rx exec_script.linux.sh
#or:# chmod +rx exec_script.mac.command
```

3. Open a text editor, write a program using JoshScript codes above, then click "Save As".

4. Change the file type to "All Files", if the dialog window has that option, name your  
program anything you like that ends in _.jsh_ (for example "program1.jsh") and save it.

5. To run your program, open the file with _execute_script.bat\*_ - find it  
using your file manager's "choose another app" or "browse" option.

_\*_ the file _execute_script.bat_, for (Microsoft) Windows, or one  
of the following to be used on other operating system(OS)s:  
 \- _exec_script.linux.sh_, a bash shell script for (GNU/)Linux.  
 \- _exec_script.mac.command_, a bash script for MacOS.

Your JoshScript code should now run successfully.  
(Note: you need Python 3.6 installed for this to work)

## About this language
In this section, there's some information about this language that could help  
to answer questions about the original version called *JoshScript*, or E-Script,  
for example *"why was it created?"* and *"what can it be used for?"*.

**• Why and when created**

The *JoshScript* scripting / programming language appeared (in GitHub)  
on 23 August 2017 and the E-Script version was created in December 2017.  
E-Script was made as an experiment idea, a simple language, for fun.  
Both languages were made with the thought that "anyone can learn" them.

**• What use, links to low-level programming**

The languages have many "Usage codes" / "Operations (codes for usage)"  
that can be used for anything, mainly math(ematic)s calculations.

They are a bit like low-level computer programming and a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).
