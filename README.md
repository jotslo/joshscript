**josH** divides the value by 2 and rounds down to the nearest integer

**JOsh** outputs the ascii repr. of the current value

**joSH** takes input and sets the value to the ascii repr. of the char

**jOsh** sets the value to 0

**JOSh** squares the value

**JosH** outputs the current value

**JoSH** moves one to the right on the tape reel

**joSh** moves one to the left on the tape reel
